apriori
=======

A Java implementation of [Apriori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori_algorithm), a classical algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over transactional databases. The algorithm was introduced in 1994 in the article [Fast algorithms for mining association rules](http://www.vldb.org/conf/1994/P487.PDF) by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant. The implementation depends on [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) library and is accompanied by unit tests covering it in 100%.
